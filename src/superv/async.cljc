  form a supervision tree. Whenever this passed supervisor aborts the context,

  this supervisor if you want a clean synchronized shutdown. The concept is

  aborted with an exception on error to force total termination. The
  supervisor waits until all supervised go-routines are finished and
  have freed resources before restarting.

  If exceptions are not taken from go-try channels (by error), they become stale
  after the stale-timeout and trigger a restart or are propagated to the parent
  supervisor (if available) and the return value.
